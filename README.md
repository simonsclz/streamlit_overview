# Overview about Streamlit

This project intents to give a simple and
easy-to-read overview about Streamlit,
a Python-framework to build web-apps
for data science.

## Who this project is for

This project gives an introduction of how
Streamlit works. The basic mechanisms
and some built-ins are explained.
Therefore, this project is for beginners,
who want to start developing web-apps with
Streamlit.
Since the app is written in Streamlit itself
(and a little HTML), it is possible to use
it as a "hands-on"-example.

## How to use

The web-app is hosted in Streamlit-Cloud.
